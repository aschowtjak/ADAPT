# ADAPT (A Diversely Applicable Parameter identification Tool)
ADAPT is designed for the inverse parameter identification of constitutive material models using mathmatical optimisation. It is designed to work with finite element simulations but its modular implementation offers an interface to basically any simulation framework. The tool is able to use global data such as forces as well as local data such as strain or displacement fields for the model calibration. The latter one is based on a robust interpolation scheme for irregular data sets and meshes/query points.
